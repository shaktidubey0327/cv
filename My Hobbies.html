      <strong><em>All Leaders are Readers </em></strong> <br>
    If you know me you might be thinking why I started reading and how it became my hobbie it is very simple and it goes like this, The time I started to learn more about money my one and only goal was to be rich and wealthy but not know this is a whole another topic to talk about, continuing with this I wanted to be rich and In this generation where interner is easily avialiable and we are exposed to youtube and other social media platforms I started to know more about rich and wealthy people and I came through a very common habit of them that is reading books and as a student I was limited by resources and have only one habit that I can replicate in my own life. This is why I started reading books. My favourite book is <strong>Rich Dad and Poor Dad</strong> by <em>Robert T Kiosaki</em>. <br>

      After doing all my work, I used to get some spare time and in that time I wanted to enjoy as well as get some value so I started watching anime after getting my friends suggestios and probably now you will be thinking that watching anime does not give some kind of knowledge nor it is good and it is just like cartoon, that's exaxtly the same what I used to think about it but it's not like that. You get more then that some of the qoutes and conversetation's in anime movies and series make you think deeply about life from another aspect. If you have some time to spare then I recomende you to start watching anime. My favourite anime movie is <strong>Death Note</strong> and all time favourite show is <strong>Naruto</strong>. <br>

      I am that kind of a person that always try and learn new things by experiencing new flavours of life. I have learned dancing and I used to dance back in my school days and I was pretty good at it by that I mean I have won some competitions too not solo because i was having stage fear and I have also learned many things in that journey. Now I have started to learn about public speaking and also I am learning New languages Like Spanish and French. I will try to share my experince by creating videos and posting it on social media or youtube.
